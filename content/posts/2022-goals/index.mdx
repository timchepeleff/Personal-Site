Time flies, and before you know it, another year has passed. Instead of setting goals in a vacuum, I'm going to share them a bit more broadly.

## Why These Goals?

Some are personal growth goals like reading 12 books. I want to improve myself in different ways and this is a good way to track that. Other goals, like reaching the top percentile in Halo Infinite or improving my Handicap, are more about personal achievement and competition.

The rest? They're pretty much to keep me moving as I continue to adjust to full-time WFH. I really want to make sure I spend time more time doing things I never regret, and that make me feel good.
