Time flies, and before you know it another year has passed. Instead of setting my goals in the vacuum that is my mind I'm going to share them here:

- Ride (Bicycle): 1000 miles.
- Walk: Avg 7000 Steps Day.
- Lift: 150 Times. Some strength goals:
  - Bench: 365LB 1RM.
  - Squat: 425LB 1RM.
  - Sholder Press: 225LB 1RM.
  - Barbell Row: 315LB 1RM.
- Read: 12 Books.
- Reach 8 Handicap in golf. (Ended 2021 as an 11.5 handicap)
- Spin up a side project. Make $1.00 of revenue.
- Watch: All James Bond Movies with Madison.
- Watch: All old Jim Carry Movies with Madison.
- Reach top 1% of ranked players in Halo Infinite. At time of writing, I'm in the top 2.5%.


## Why These Goals?

Some are personal growth goals like reading 12 books. I want to improve myself in different ways and this is a good way to track that. Other goals, like reaching the top percentile in Halo Infinite or improving my Handicap, are more about personal achievement and competition.

The rest? They're pretty much to keep me moving physically as I continue to adjust to full-time WFH. I want to make sure I spend time more time doing things I never regret.
