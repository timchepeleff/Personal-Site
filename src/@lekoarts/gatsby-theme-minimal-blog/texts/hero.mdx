### Hey, I'm Tim Chepeleff. ðŸ‘‹

I like to solve problems with technology. Lately, I've been building tools for other developers that make their day-to-day just that much better. I focus on keeping it simple. Always working to reduce the numbers of decisions they need to worry about - convention over configuration.

At the moment I'm working as a Staff Engineer [@Wayfair](https://tech.wayfair.com/) where I'm promoting sane (and opinionated) release patterns that are used by well over 1000 different services on a daily basis. Previously, I was consulting with early-stage startups [@BarbershopLabs](http://barbershoplabs.com/) helping to deliver their MVPs to market. _Quickly_.

Every so often I'll post my rants and rambles here. Want to know more?  Get in touch!
