### Hey, I'm Tim Chepeleff. ðŸ‘‹

I like to solve problems with technology.

At the moment I'm working as a Staff Engineer [@Wayfair](https://tech.wayfair.com/) where I'm promoting sane (and opinionated) release patterns that are used by well over 1000 different services on a daily basis. Previously, I was consulting with early stage startups [@BarbershopLabs](http://barbershoplabs.com/) where I helping to deliver their MVP's to market.

Lately my obsession for building tooling for other developers has been growing exponentially. I focus on keeping it simple, never distracting the developer. Plenty of things do that well enough already.

Every so often I'll post my rants and rambles here. Want to know more?  Get in touch!
