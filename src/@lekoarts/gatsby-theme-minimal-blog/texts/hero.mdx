### Hey, I'm Tim Chepeleff. ðŸ‘‹

I like to solve problems with technology.

At the moment I'm working as a Staff Engineer [@Wayfair](https://tech.wayfair.com/) where I'm promoting sane (and opinionated) deployment patterns that are used by well over 1000 different services on a daily basis. Previously, I was consulting with early stage startups [@BarbershopLabs](http://barbershoplabs.com/) where I was quickly delivering POCs and MVPs to market.

Every so often I post my thoughts here. Want to know more? Get in touch!
